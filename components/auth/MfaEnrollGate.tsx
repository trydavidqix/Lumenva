/**
 * Full-viewport blocker shown to users (admin / platform_admin) who haven't
 * enrolled MFA yet. The modal cannot be dismissed — the user MUST complete
 * enrollment to access the app.
 *
 * The blocking decision is LATCHED on first mount: `confirmMfaEnroll` is a
 * Server Action, and Next.js revalidates the route when it returns. If the
 * gate re-read `enrolled` live, the freshly-verified factor would flip it to
 * "enrolled" and unmount this modal — destroying the one-time recovery codes
 * before the user could save them. Latching keeps the modal alive until the
 * user acknowledges and the modal itself reloads the page.
